title: Helping Mommas Find Their Happy Medium
---

MommaFinds is a weekly newsletter that aggregates your options when it comes to making important decisions on how to raise your baby. Each newsletter breaks down pros and cons to going all one way or the other and then shows how you could mix and match.

As millennial mommas we have different challenges than our parents and grandparents. We have too much information at our fingertips and everyone has opinions about "the right way" to raise YOUR baby.

The only person who knows how to raise your baby, is you. There is no right or wrong way. There is no this or that. There is no ALL or nothing.

There is however, a happy medium.
