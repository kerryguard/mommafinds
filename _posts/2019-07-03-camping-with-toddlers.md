## KISS

When it comes to camping in general it's easy to under do it or over do it. With Toddlers it's usually the latter. And in our case we over did it with every thing except the essentials... enough clothes to last a life time.

We brought rolls and rolls of toilet paper, waaaaaaaaay too much fruit and chips, and not NEARLY enough clothes for any of us. I forgot my toothbrush. We didn't bring anything to wash our dishes.

We had fun though. Enough to want to do it again packing much smarter than we had.

Here's what I will pack next time:

---

## Clothes

**For Toddlers (I'm Not Exaggerating)**
+ 4 Pairs of Underwear for each day
+ 4 Pairs of socks for each day
+ 4 Pairs of pants for each day
+ 4 Shirts for each day
+ 2 Hoodie/pullover for each day
+ 2 - 3 wind breakers
+ 1 - 2 [Hats with 50+ UV protection](https://amzn.to/2XiUlf7)
+ 1 - 2 pairs of sunglass
+ 2 - 3 pairs of [shoes](http://www.mommafinds.com/2018/07/01/baby-first-shoes/)
+ 2 Bathing Suits
+ At least 2-4 pairs of footie PJs (depending on how long you're going)

I will say there is very little worse than cold kids while camping. Having been out of warm clothes by the morning of the last day we had no choice but to leave straight after breakfast. My kids literally put themselves in the car.

**For Adults**
For us it's really just about the layers. We don't play nearly as hard so having to bring so many outfits a day isn't necessary, but making sure we're warm enough is. I forgot my rain coat, a sweatshirt (or 4), and socks. Needless to say, I was freezing.

## Food

The KISS rule never applied so hard. I thought my kids were going to be WAY hungry than they were. Here were the meals I made for the two days we were camping:
+ Dinner the first night we at a nearby restaurant
+ Breakfast: Eggs, Coffee from a coffee press, tea
+ Snack: Annie's "Energy Bar" and an Apple Sauce Pouch
+ Lunch: Grilled Cheese, peppers and hummus
+ Dinner: A friend of ours orchestrated an entire meal of steak, skewers of peppers, and roasted mushroom.
+ Snack: S'Mores and Banana with Melted Chocolate
+ Breakfast: Eggs and Sausage

I had all these intensions like making homemade guacamole and sharing chips and fruit with friends that just never happened. We also brought Mac and Cheese for the kids and a whole carton of milk we never even cracked open. Hot dogs and bacon we never cooked.

Next time I'm going to stick to more dry foods and less fruit. The [Apple Sauce pouches](https://amzn.to/2IXEARY) for sure. The grilled cheese was actually a great idea for lunch. One bag of chips and one bag of pretzels next time along with our [energy bars](https://amzn.to/2XgIZZ5).

And I really recommend straight up meal planning and not diverging from it. Know what you're going to cook for each meal and bring only what you need. Try and use similar ingredients for multiple meals - like we used the cheese, butter, and eggs for multiple meals.

## Cooking

+ This little [cooking set](https://amzn.to/2NmSJfw) was a GOD send and came with everything including plates, sporks, flipper, cooking/serving spoon. Our friend's had [this one](https://amzn.to/2FIelwN) which came with 4 cups as well and like the other one packed up nicely.
+ [Tongs](https://amzn.to/2J0EWXW) (BIG ones for flipping and also for moving wood in a fire around)
+ This [little tin boils water super fast](https://amzn.to/2XGKwXI) on a stove and comes with two cups. Our friend's used [this which worked well if you don't need a stove](https://amzn.to/2XCdRCB).
+ I love this [French Press](https://amzn.to/2XiFVLL) and now use it at home. I made a pot in the morning and it lasted me all day and stayed hot for hours.
+ This [stove](https://amzn.to/2NmBRpf) was awesome and seemed to the be the stove of choice where we were.
+ Propane for the stove
+ [Two wash basins](https://amzn.to/2XkOqpF) (one for boiled water and soap, another for rinse) - we forgot this and washing dishes was a huge pain.
+ [Water Storage](https://amzn.to/2XHlHe7) with Spout to keep from having to go back and forth from the water spigot.
+ A little set of knives (which we also forgot and had to use a big utility knife for everything)
+ Cutting board
+ Napkins/Paper towels
+ 2 Dish Towels
+ Trash bags for trash from cooking and also for dirty Clothes
+ Wood, kindling, newspaper,
+ Fire starter (matches, long lighter)
+ Hotdog Forks - we got luckily where our friends brought these

We brought coal we definitely didn't need and wouldn't bring again.

I wish we had a table cloth or something to cover the picnic table. It tended to drizzle in the morning and would have been nice to have a dry place to sit comfortably.

## Sleeping

+ Tent - this was our first time and we weren't sure we were going to like it so we crammed in a [2 person tent](https://amzn.to/2XehwC6). The second night we found having the kids sleep at one end on either side and us sleeping at the other with our feet between them was the best set up. They need their space when they sleep and we don't mind being close to one another. We slept really well considering. If we go again, our friends at a 6 person tent for the 4 of them. They should stand up, bring their bags inside, and use it for sleeping and privacy. We will probably upgrade next time.
+ Sleeping bag for each person. We got [these for the kids](https://amzn.to/2X9l0WB) and they kept them warm and weren't too bulky given the limited space..
+ Pillow for each person
+ Each child's lovey - Obvious but let's make not of all necessities
+ A few books for bedtime and downtime. I did two each - one 5 minute story collection and one smaller book.
+ Flashlight for each person and a lantern for the tent
+ White noise - I didn't have this the first night and it took FOREVER for my kids to fall asleep. I played it the next day at naps and bedtime and they conked right out and slept through the night. GAME CHANGER.

## Toiletries and First Aid

+ Toothbrush for each personal (pack an extra incase one falls on the floor)
+ Toothpaste
+ Hand sanitizer
+ For you, momma, face wash clothes - just makes you feel refreshed before bed and when you wake up. I take these on planes too. It's a quick reset.
+ Face Cream with an SPF
+ Sunscreen for kids wit 50+ SPF
+ Bug Spray
+ One towel for each person (pack extra if you're planning on swimming)
+ Shampoo and body wash (If there are showers and you're planning on taking one). We only stayed two nights and it wasn't worth it to me as my kids aren't big fans of showers just yet. I washed them and their hair the night before we left and again the night we got home.
+ Toilet paper - the bathroom's at the place we stayed were awesome so we didn't need to bring this, but doesn't hurt just incase.

---

## Entertainment

+ Coloring bookshelves
+ Card Games - [Charades](https://amzn.to/2XIun3T) and [Eye Found It](https://amzn.to/2FIIA6F)
+ One Ball

I think we could have brought a few more things had we not gone with friends who thought to bring sand toys for the beach and extra balls and things to kick around. There were a ton of kids there with scooters because there was small paved road that went around the campground. I think our kids would have liked to have had theirs, just wasn't room to pack them. Maybe next time.

## Find Your Happy Medium

We started reading to them at just a few months old and haven't stopped. Their love for reading is magical. To the point where my daughter put down her tablet, leaped off the sofa, and ran to her brother's bed to hear her dad read a story. Books greater than tablets. My work here is done.

This is a very small selection of our most prized favorites. This list barely scratches the surface of what's out there. OH! [5 Minute Story Collection books](https://amzn.to/2XcGSV1). We have a TON of those and they are great bedtime stories because we read one before bed and there's very little kick back of wanting more. They're the perfect length.

Anyway, find books  you love and inspire you because if you love reading to them they will fall in love with reading. You'll be more excited about telling them the story, making up silly voices, exaggerating certain words, which will hold their attention and create this unbreakable bond between you.

As always, you do you and keep finding your happy medium, one page at a time.
