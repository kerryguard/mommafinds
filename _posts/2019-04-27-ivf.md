title: Sometimes There Are No Happy Mediums
meta: Making the crucial decision of IVF or no IVF. No one can give you enough advise to make that decision for you and your spouse. Somethings are better left unsaid.

**In Vitro Fertilization also known as IVF is when you retrieve eggs from the women, sperm from the man, and in a controlled environment fertilize the egg. 3 or 5 days later the egg (or multiple) are then transferred in the women's uterus. See Season 4, episode 12 of Friends. The eggs may also be frozen to be transferred at a later date.**

## You Are Not Alone

This was how most conversations went when strangers learned I was carrying twins.

Stranger: TWINS?! Boys or Girls?

Me: Boy and a girl.

Stranger: One of each! Are they identical???

Me: (Inquisitive look)... Nooo...

Stranger: Do twins run in your family?!

Me: Technically yes... But I went through IVF...

Awkward silence.

Stranger: Well, Congratulations.

This is how most conversations went.

And on the rare occasion it was met with understanding. Oh, I did that too! Which lead to a whole conversation of what their story was. And every story is different. I have met COUNTLESS women who have taken the IVF journey and every, single, story was different. Some went well - on the first go, no issues, and others were harder.

It's amazing the network you create when you're open about how you were able to conceive and how with each story you feel less, and less alone.

## Making the decision

I'm not going to tell my story, because for those who are trying to figure out what's next for them, my story isn't going to help one way or another.

The advise I will give is this...

1. Talk your doctors. Ask the questions around their recommendations and what to expect. They'll tell you as much as you need to know.
2. If you do talk to friends, they should be sounding boards. You should be doing most of the talking. Repeating what the doctor said, your situation, and why you're on the fence.  Can I get a pro con list anyone?

## Here's the Thing

You and your spouse are going to make the decision on what's best for you, the family you're hoping to build, and your finances.

My husband explored ALL options from just keep trying naturally, [IUI](https://americanpregnancy.org/infertility/intrauterine-insemination/),  IVF, adoption, or buying a yacht, sailing the world, and not having kids at all. We searched ALL options. And in each step we took, we kept all our other options open.

We came to a cross roads a couple times with IVF, and the question we kept coming back to was, are we making progress? At each interval something different happened and we needed to know it was always a step forward.


## Find Your Happy Medium

In this case, there is no happy medium. You're either in or your not when it comes to IVF.

If you do make the IVF decision - you power through the rest. You take a day at at time. One injection at a time. You follow your doctors orders. It becomes part of your routine. You breathe. You keep your eye on the prize. You use distractions like passion projects. And above all else - **you give yourself a break.**

I will say, giving birth and the aftermath left a bigger impression on me then what I went through to get pregnant.

In both, birth and the IVF process, as a women, you find away.  

And if you decide IVF is not for you, that's okay too.

As always, you do you.
