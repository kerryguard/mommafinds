Hello, and welcome to my weekly email newsletter, MommaFinds.</p>

I'm a momma of toddler twins, boy and a girl. I co-won my the digital marketing agency, <a href="https://mkgmarketinginc.com">MKG Marketing</a>. I work from home and have a nanny look after the twins why my husband works at an office.</p>

I started MommaFinds because as a new mom I felt overwhelmed by all the conflicting information. I'd go headlong in one direction, like 100% breastfeeding or 100% done with diapers when potty training. Through each experience my husband taught me that it doesn't have to be all one way or another. There's a happy medium. Start with one thing, then small tweaks until you find what works for you.</p>

I don't want to add to the noise of information that already exists. I simply want to aggregate it. Root through the opinions to simply present options when it comes to raising babies. There is no right way. No one size fits all. It's about your lifestyle, your ideals, and your instincts.<p>

I'm just hear to help you find the happy medium in all your options.</p>
